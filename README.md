  <p>The main motive of this project is to build a machine learning algorithms and deep learning networks from scratch. And understand what underneath in it; How every network works, This project initially for beginners who don't know about the deep learning and machine learning algorithms in details</p>
<h2 align='center'> First: Designing Deep Neural Netowrks such as:</h2>

<h3> Artificial Neural Networks(ANN)</h3>
<h3>Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)</h3>
<h3>Convolution Neural Networks(CNN)</h3>
<h3>Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)</h3>
